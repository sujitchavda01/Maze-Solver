# Maze Solver using Flood Fill Algorithm

This is a **Maze Solver Application** that uses the **Flood Fill Algorithm** to find a path through a maze. It is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Python**, and visually demonstrates how a flood-fill algorithm can traverse a grid-based maze to reach the goal.

## üß† Description

The project visualizes the process of solving a maze where:

- The maze is represented as a grid of cells.
- Walls, paths, start point, and end point are all defined in the structure.
- The flood-fill algorithm recursively explores possible paths from the starting point until it reaches the destination.
- Once the goal is reached, the shortest path can be traced visually (or highlighted).

## üîç Features

- Simple grid-based maze representation.
- Visualization of the flood-fill algorithm in action.
- Basic user interface using HTML & CSS.
- Backend logic written in Python for solving the maze.

## üí° Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**  
  - HTML5  
  - CSS3  

- **Backend / Logic:**  
  - Python 3  
  - Flood Fill Algorithm for pathfinding

## üß≠ Algorithm Used
### Flood Fill Algorithm:

- Flood fill is a pathfinding technique commonly used in paint tools and maze solving. It recursively visits all reachable paths from a starting point, marking them as visited, and continues until it reaches the goal.
